# Machine Learning Coursera
This repository contains the programming assignments for Andrew Ng's Coursera class, "Machine Learning". The course topics were the following and the algorithms were implemented in Octave:<br>

Exercise 1 - Multivariable Linear Regression<br>
Exercise 2 - Regularization<br>
Exercise 3 - Neural Network Representation<br>
Exercise 4 - Neural Network Learning<br>
Exercise 5 - Application - Bias and Variance<br>
Exercise 6 - Support Vector Machines and Kernels<br>
Exercise 7 - Dimensionality Reduction - K-Means Clustering and PCA<br>
Exercise 8 - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems<br>

I took this class at the end of 2015.
